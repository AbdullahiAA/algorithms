# Algorithms
This repo contains some of the Algorithms that I have practiced.

## 01 - Match Brackets
This is an algorithm question that tests whether the set of brackets are closed appropriately or not.

### Examples:
- `()` - true
- `()[]{}` - true
- `(]` - false
- `([)]` - false
- `{[]}` - true
- `((([[[{}]])))` - false
- `((([[[{}]]])))` - true
